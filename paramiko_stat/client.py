        """
        Connect to an SSH server and authenticate to it.  The server's host key
        is checked against the system host keys (see `load_system_host_keys`)
        and any local host keys (`load_host_keys`).  If the server's hostname
        is not found in either set of host keys, the missing host key policy
        is used (see `set_missing_host_key_policy`).  The default policy is
        to reject the key and raise an `.SSHException`.
        Authentication is attempted in the following order of priority:
            - The ``pkey`` or ``key_filename`` passed in (if any)
              - ``key_filename`` may contain OpenSSH public certificate paths
                as well as regular private-key paths; when files ending in
                ``-cert.pub`` are found, they are assumed to match a private
                key, and both components will be loaded. (The private key
                itself does *not* need to be listed in ``key_filename`` for
                this to occur - *just* the certificate.)
            - Any key we can find through an SSH agent
            - Any "id_rsa", "id_dsa" or "id_ecdsa" key discoverable in
              ``~/.ssh/``
              - When OpenSSH-style public certificates exist that match an
                existing such private key (so e.g. one has ``id_rsa`` and
                ``id_rsa-cert.pub``) the certificate will be loaded alongside
                the private key and used for authentication.
            - Plain username/password auth, if a password was given
        If a private key requires a password to unlock it, and a password is
        passed in, that password will be used to attempt to unlock the key.
        :param str hostname: the server to connect to
        :param int port: the server port to connect to
        :param str username:
            the username to authenticate as (defaults to the current local
            username)
        :param str password:
            Used for password authentication; is also used for private key
            decryption if ``passphrase`` is not given.
        :param str passphrase:
            Used for decrypting private keys.
        :param .PKey pkey: an optional private key to use for authentication
        :param str key_filename:
            the filename, or list of filenames, of optional private key(s)
            and/or certs to try for authentication
        :param float timeout:
            an optional timeout (in seconds) for the TCP connect
        :param bool allow_agent:
            set to False to disable connecting to the SSH agent
        :param bool look_for_keys:
            set to False to disable searching for discoverable private key
            files in ``~/.ssh/``
        :param bool compress: set to True to turn on compression
        :param socket sock:
            an open socket or socket-like object (such as a `.Channel`) to use
            for communication to the target host
        :param bool gss_auth:
            ``True`` if you want to use GSS-API authentication
        :param bool gss_kex:
            Perform GSS-API Key Exchange and user authentication
        :param bool gss_deleg_creds: Delegate GSS-API client credentials or not
        :param str gss_host:
            The targets name in the kerberos database. default: hostname
        :param bool gss_trust_dns:
            Indicates whether or not the DNS is trusted to securely
            canonicalize the name of the host being connected to (default
            ``True``).
        :param float banner_timeout: an optional timeout (in seconds) to wait
            for the SSH banner to be presented.
        :param float auth_timeout: an optional timeout (in seconds) to wait for
            an authentication response.
        :param float channel_timeout: an optional timeout (in seconds) to wait
             for a channel open response.
        :param dict disabled_algorithms:
            an optional dict passed directly to `.Transport` and its keyword
            argument of the same name.
        :param transport_factory:
            an optional callable which is handed a subset of the constructor
            arguments (primarily those related to the socket, GSS
            functionality, and algorithm selection) and generates a
            `.Transport` instance to be used by this client. Defaults to
            `.Transport.__init__`.
        :raises BadHostKeyException:
            if the server's host key could not be verified.
        :raises AuthenticationException: if authentication failed.
        :raises socket.error:
            if a socket error (other than connection-refused or
            host-unreachable) occurred while connecting.
        :raises NoValidConnectionsError:
            if all valid connection targets for the requested hostname (eg IPv4
            and IPv6) yielded connection-refused or host-unreachable socket
            errors.
        :raises SSHException:
            if there was any other error connecting or establishing an SSH
            session.
